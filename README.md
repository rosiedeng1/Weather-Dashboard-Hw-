# Weather-Dashboard-Hw-

## Description

The motivation behind the project was to create a weather application for users to see current and future weather conditions for any city that they input. We built this project to make it easier for users to see what the weather is like based on the city so that they can plan accordingly/have a better idea of what the weather will be like. When they view the city, they can see the date and data about that city's weather such as the temperature, humidity, windSpeed, etc for both the current day and a five day forecast. Additionally, they should be able to see the weather conditions for any city they input in their search history by clicking on the button of any city they previously input. It solves the problem of creating a space to see specific weather data for users in a clear and easy to manage way. I learned a lot about using the fetch method to retrieve data from an API, using local storage to store relevant data, extracting specific components from the API, manipulating strings, objects, and arrays using JSONparse and stringify, and practicing different functions in js to get everything to come together.
